                     With over 70 cigar brands, the company has expanded to become a popular online retailer, serving
                     customers all across Canada. Despite its growth, Smoke Master Cigars remains committed to providing

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     Growing up in the southern part of Lebanon, Moe Mokbel was exposed to a diverse range of cigar
                     brands
                     from an early age. The region was home to many tobacco fields, and during the 1970s, Lebanon’s
                     cigar
                     industry was thriving, with many of the world’s largest cigar brands having a strong market
                     presence
                     in the country. The fertile soil produced high-quality tobacco, which was used to create some of
                     the
                     world’s finest cigars.

                  Moe’s career path led him to the electrical field, but he still pursued his passion for cigars on the
                  side. However, the 1970s in Lebanon were marked by political turmoil and civil unrest, with the
                  country on the verge of civil war. The economic and social instability of the time made living in
                  Lebanon difficult, prompting Moe Mokbel to relocate to Canada in the early 1980s.

                  <h2>THE FOUNDING OF SMOKE MASTER CIGARS</h2>
                  <h3>
                     With over 70 cigar brands, the company has expanded to become a popular online retailer, serving
                     customers all across Canada. Despite its growth, Smoke Master Cigars remains committed to providing

                  <p>
                     Moe had a strong affection for Canada and worked as an electrician for almost 15 years before
                     developing rheumatoid arthritis, which made it necessary for him to retire early from his
                     physically demanding electrical job. Due to this, he had to find a less physically challenging
                     profession. Moe decided to pursue his passion for cigars and opened his first store in the early
                     2000s at 209 Carlton Street, St. Catharines Ontario.
                  </p>
                  <p>Today Smoke Master Cigars has grown from a
                     small store with two humidors to a spacious new location at 145 Carlton Street in St. Catharines.
                     This new location houses 11 double-door humidors and over 70 cigar brands. The company has also
                     expanded to become a popular online retailer, serving customers all across Canada. Despite its
                     growth, Smoke Master Cigars remains committed to providing the best possible cigar shopping
                     experience.

                     <p>
                        One might argue it is the most famous Robusto sized cigar on the market, known for its superior
                        flavour and notes of creamy, hay, earth and pepper. Partagas continues to make outstanding
                        blends in multiple sizes, which are all available in the Smoke Master Cigar catalog.
